A machine learning simple beginner project using SDSS data to classify celestial objects into stars, galaxies, and quasars. We showcase multiple algorithms to demonstrate practical data science and astronomical data analytics.

---

## Overview

This project uses Python and scikit-learn to implement a suite of classifiers:

- **Linear Regression** (adapted for classification): A simple baseline.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: For finding optimal separating hyperplanes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**: An intuitive, instance-based approach.
- **Decision Tree**: Offers clear, interpretable decisions.

We go from data preprocessing through model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalizing, and splitting the SDSS dataset.
- **Model Training:** Hands-on implementation of four diverse machine learning algorithms.
- **Visualization:** Comprehensive graphs and plots that illustrate data distribution, decision boundaries, and performance metrics.
- **Insights & Analysis:** Clear interpretation of results and discussion on each modelâ€™s strengths and limitations.

## Data

The data comes from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)](http://www.sdss.org/). It includes essential photometric measurements that help in distinguishing stars, galaxies, and quasars.
